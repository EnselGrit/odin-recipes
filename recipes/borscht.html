        <h2>What Is Borscht?</h2>
        <p>Borscht is a sour soup that is traditionally made with meat stock and boiled vegetables.</p>
        <p>The Ukrainian version, which features beets, is perhaps the most well known type â€” but varieties of borscht can be found throughout Central and Eastern Europe and Northern Asia.</p>

        <h2>Borscht Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sausage</strong>: This Ukrainian borscht recipe starts with a pound of pork sausage.</li>
            <li><strong>Vegetables</strong>: You'll need beets, carrots, baking potatoes, cabbage, and an onion.</li>
            <li><strong>Canned tomatoes</strong>: Use drained diced tomatoes and canned tomato paste.</li>
            <li><strong>Vegetable oil</strong>: Cook the onion in oil.</li>
            <li><strong>Water</strong>: You'll need almost nine cups of water for this big-batch soup.</li>
            <li><strong>Garlic</strong>: Three cloves of garlic add bold flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: A teaspoon of white sugar lends subtle sweetness.</li>
