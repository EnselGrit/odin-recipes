        <h2>What is Whole Orange Blender Cake ?</h2>
        <p>This whole orange blender cake is a pretty domed loaf, nicely sweet with big orange flavor, and even a tantalizing hint of delightful bitterness.</p>
        <p>It's also nice to have only the blender jar to wash when you're done!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 navel orange or other thin-skinned orange, at room temperature</li>
            <li>3 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1/3 cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2/3 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup confectioner's sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon orange juice or milk</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Make Whole Orange Blender Cake</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Coat an 8x4-inch loaf pan with nonstick spray and line with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Wash the orange and blot dry with paper towels. Cut in 8ths, removing any seeds.</li>
            <li>Combine orange pieces, eggs, sugar, melted butter, and vanilla in a blender. Cover and blend until smooth, about 30 seconds. Add flour, baking powder, and salt. Cover and pulse just until combined and batter is smooth.</li>
            <li>Add batter to prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cool in the pan on a wire rack 10 minutes. Remove from pan and cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
            <li>Whisk together powdered sugar and orange juice until smooth. Drizzle over the cooled loaf.</li>
        </ol>
